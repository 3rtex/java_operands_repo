# Arithmetic operators

Since arithmetic operators are quite easy to understand, here is a small problem to resolve with some of them.

If you need a refresh you can go read the [introduction](course://Basics/Introduction) containing explanation about the operators.

## Problem 

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

You will need the modulo arithmetic operator and a loop.
